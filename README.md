# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

[image1]: ./Architecture_Diagrams/V_model.png

The goal of the project is to create documentation for functional safety of a Lane Assistance system considering the **Road Vehicles Functional Safety Standard [ISO 26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262)**.
In this way I can demonstrate what I have learned in the lessons of this elective module.

The Lane Assistance system is part of a [Advanced Driver Assistance System(ADAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems).
The Lane Assistance has two main funcionalitis:
* Lane departure warning
* Lane keeping assistance.

The ISO 26262 is using V model to cover entired vehicle safety life time, starting from planning, designing, testing, production and post production, see picture below:

The project mostly focus on the left side of the V model, which includes planning and designing functionally safe systems.

These two functionalities are used in whole project a reference to demonstrate all steps must be done create documentation about functional safety.


Following reports were created by me to document the functional safety of a Lane Assistance system:
* Safety Plan
* Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
* Functional Safety Concept
* Technical Safety Concept
* Software Requirements

The documents can be found as pdf files in main folder.
